# Log Analysis Project

## Overview
A Python-based tool to analyze server logs and extract meaningful insights such as:
- Request counts by IP address
- Most frequently accessed endpoints
- Suspicious activity (e.g., excessive failed logins)

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains log files.
- `src/`: Core Python scripts for parsing, analysis, and output.
- `results/`: Output files generated by the program.

## Usage
1. Place your log file in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
